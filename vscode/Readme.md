# Ewe Studios DevContainers
A repo of different VSCode DevContainer configurations and additional configurations (e.g keybindings) to make development life simple and easy.

## VSCode DevContainers Info

The devcontainer always sets up .vscode config under:

```
/home/vscode/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json
```

Usually keybindings should also be in:

```
/home/vscode/.vscode-server/data/Machine/keybindings.json
```

or

```
/home/vscode/.vscode-server/data/keybindings.json
```

_Still experiementing on how to force customize keybindings to work_

## KeyBinding Customizations

I tried to make <TAB> key King, almost everything is reachable via <TAB>, you can find my custom keybindings.
