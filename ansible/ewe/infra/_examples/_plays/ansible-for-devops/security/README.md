# Security Examples for Ansible

This directory contains playbooks used for security hardening with Ansible, and is meant as a companion to the examples and text in chapter 11 of [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com).

## Quick Start Guide

### 1 - Install dependencies (VirtualBox, Vagrant, Ansible)

  1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
  2. Download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
  3. [Mac/Linux only] Install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

Note for Windows users: *This guide assumes you're on a Mac or Linux host. Windows hosts are unsupported at this time.*

### 2 - Build the Virtual Machine

  1. Download this project and put it wherever you want.
  2. Open Terminal, cd to this directory (containing the `Vagrantfile` and this README file).
  3. Type in `vagrant up`, and let Vagrant do its magic.

Note: *If there are any errors during the course of running `vagrant up`, and it drops you back to your command prompt, just run `vagrant provision` to continue building the VM from where you left off. If there are still errors after doing this a few times, post an issue to this project's issue queue on GitHub with the error.*
