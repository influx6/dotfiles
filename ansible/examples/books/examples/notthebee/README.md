# notthebee/infra

An Ansible playbook that sets up an Ubuntu-based home media server/NAS with reasonable security, auto-updates, e-mail notifications for S.M.A.R.T. and Snapraid errors and dynamic DNS. 

It assumes a fresh Ubuntu Server 20.04 install, access to a non-root user with sudo privileges and a public SSH key. This can be configured during the installation process.

The playbook is mostly being developed for personal use, so stuff is going to be constantly changing and breaking. Use at your own risk and don't expect any help in setting it up on your machine.

## Special thanks
* David Stephens for his [Ansible NAS](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) project. This is where I got the idea and "borrowed" a lot of concepts and implementations from.
* Jeff Geerling for his book, [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) and his [Ansible 101 series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN) on YouTube.
* Jonathan Hanson for his [SSH port juggling](https://gist.github.com/triplepoint/1ad6c6060c0f12112403d98180bcf0b4) implementation.

## Usage
Install Ansible (macOS):
```
brew install ansible
```

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/notthebee/infra
```

Create a host varialbe file and adjust the variables:
```
cd infra/
mkdir -p host_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME
vi host_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME/vars.yml
```

Create a Keychain item for your Ansible Vault password (on macOS):
```
security add-generic-password \
               -a YOUR_USERNAME \
               -s ansible-vault-password \
               -w
```

The `pass.sh` script will extract the Ansible Vault password from your Keychain automatically each time Ansible requests it.

Create an encrypted `secret.yml` file and adjust the variables:
```
ansible-vault create host_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME/secret.yml
ansible-vault edit host_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME/secret.yml
```

Add your custom inventory file to `hosts`:
```
cp hosts_example hosts
vi hosts
```

Install the dependencies:
```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

Finally, run the playbook:
```
ansible-playbook run.yml -l your-host-here -K
```
The "-K" parameter is only necessary for the first run, since the playbook configures passwordless sudo for the main login user

For consecutive runs, if you only want to update the Docker containers, you can run the playbook like this:
```
ansible-playbook run.yml --tags="port,containers"
```
